# This is the official GitHub page for Exterminium Mod for Terraria(More info. down below)

# Version Changelog:
V 0.100.1 - First Release(Planned to be done in March)

# What is Extermnium?
It's a content mod(Planned to be really huge) that at the moment adds a few items, some new bosses, new enemies and a lot of other things(Lazy description I know)

# The Progression
I'm trying my best to make this mod something good, but some obstacles don't allow me to do that(One of them being the fact I'm the only guy on the Team. As well, I'm looking for some spriters to help me on making this mod, so if anyone wants to help, just join the mod server: "Put here link"
Also even if you aren't a spriter, but want to help developing it on the same way, feel free to talk to me!
