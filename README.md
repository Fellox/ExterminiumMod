# Version Changelog:
V 0.100.1 - First Release(Planned to be released on March 5, maybe earlier)

It's a content mod(Planned to be really huge) that at the moment adds a few items, some new bosses, new enemies and a lot of other things(Lazy description I know, it will get better within time, trust me)

# Who is working on it?
Yo, me! And... only me

# The Current Progression
I'm trying my best to make this mod looking good, but some obstacles don't allow me to do that(One of them being the fact I'm the only guy on the Team). As well, I'm looking for some spriters to help me on making this mod, so if anyone wants to help, just join the mod server: https://discord.gg/5bkyYQdu5h and DM me. Also even if you aren't a spriter, but want to help developing it on the same way, feel free to talk to me!
